Calculator Application (Python Tkinter)

📌 Project Description
This project is a basic calculator application built using Python’s Tkinter library.
It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform simple arithmetic operations such as:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
The calculator uses buttons for digits and operators, and an entry box to display input and results.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Tkinter (GUI library)

✨ Features
User-friendly graphical interface
Supports numbers 0–9
Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Clear button to reset input
Real-time display of inputs and results

🧮 How It Works
Number buttons append digits to the entry box.
Operator buttons (+, -, *, /) store the first number and the operation.
The = (equals) button performs the calculation.
The CLEAR button clears the entry field.
